The rotors have a disposal of blades on the outer edge in the form of a propeller. The steam acts on these blades, producing a rotary movement. The stator consists of a similar but fixed series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow to the next stage of the rotor. A steam turbine usually escapes to a surface capacitor that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are normally available to extract the maximum potential work from a specific speed and steam pressure, giving rise to a series of stages of high and low pressure variable size. The turbines are only efficient if they rotate at a relatively high speed, so they are typically connected to reductive gears. The stages of a steam turbine are usually available to drive applications of lower speed, such as the propeller of a boat.

Generally, \"first\" indicates minimality or incompatibility, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of an F field containing both 0 and 1. It is Q or the finite field with p elements, from which the name comes. Often a second additional meaning is the use of the prime word, that is, that any object can, essentially in a unique way, break down into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indescomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the sum of two non-trivial knots. Any knot can be expressed only as a connected sum of prime knots. Prime models and Prime 3-manifolds are other examples of this type.', 'In knot theory, a prime knot cannot be written as the sum of how many non-trivial knots?')":{

From the perspective of the object, all movement occurs as if there were no gravitation at all.
