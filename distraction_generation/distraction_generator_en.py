# and I wind up stuck behind Abe fucking Lincoln. Just my luck. 
# And the asshole isn't even paying attention! He's been staring at his phone the whole time.” 
# At press time, the total eclipse had reportedly become even more difficult to view after 
# Everett's girlfriend decided to perch atop his shoulders."""
